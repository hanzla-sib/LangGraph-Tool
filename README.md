## 🤖 What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a framework that helps developers build applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides:
- **Tools**: Functions that AI can call to get information or perform tasks
- **Chains**: Sequences of operations that can be linked together
- **Agents**: AI systems that can decide which tools to use and when
- **Memory**: Ways to store and recall information across conversations

## 🔗 What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is an extension of LangChain that helps build **stateful, multi-actor applications** with LLMs. Think of it as:
- **State Management**: Keeps track of conversation history and context
- **Graph-based Workflows**: Creates complex workflows where AI can make decisions
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: AI can plan, execute, and reflect on multiple steps
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly connects AI with external tools and APIs

**Key Differences:**
- **LangChain**: Basic tools and chains for simple AI applications
- **LangGraph**: Advanced state management for complex, multi-step AI workflows

## 🎯 Project Overview

This tutorial teaches you **LangGraph fundamentals** through hands-on examples:

### 📚 **What You'll Learn:**
- ✅ **Basic LangChain**: Simple while-loop approach (traditional)
- ✅ **LangGraph Nodes**: Modern AI agent architecture (professional)
- ✅ **State Management**: How data flows between components
- ✅ **Graph Building**: Connecting nodes with edges
- ✅ **Real Examples**: See both approaches working

### 🎪 **Two Learning Approaches:**

1. **Simple Loop** (`index.js`) - Traditional way, easy to understand
2. **LangGraph** (`langgraph-example.js`) - Modern way, nodes and edges

**Perfect for your first time learning!** 🌟

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

2. **Ollama** installed and running
   - Download from: https://ollama.ai/
   - Install the `llama3.1:latest` model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1:latest
   ```

3. **Basic JavaScript knowledge** (understanding of functions, async/await)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone or download** this project
2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd c:\projects\LangGraph-Tools\LangGraph-Tool
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🎮 **Try Both Approaches:**

1. **Simple Loop Approach** (Traditional):
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   node index.js
   ```

2. **LangGraph Approach** (Modern):
   ```bash
   npm run graph
   # or
   node langgraph-example.js
   ```

### 🎯 **What You'll See:**
- **Simple Loop**: AI uses tools in a linear way
- **LangGraph**: AI flows through connected nodes

Both will answer questions, but you'll see the difference in architecture!

## 🎪 Simple vs Advanced Examples

### 📁 **File Structure:**

├── index.js              # Simple loop approach (traditional)
├── langgraph-example.js   # LangGraph nodes approach (modern)
├── README.md             # This guide
├── COMPARISON.md         # Detailed comparison
└── package.json          # Dependencies
```

### 🎯 **Learning Path:**
1. **Start with** `index.js` - Understand the basics
2. **Move to** `langgraph-example.js` - See the modern approach
3. **Read** `COMPARISON.md` - Understand the differences
4. **Experiment** - Try modifying both approaches

## 🔍 Code Explanation

### 🌟 **Simple LangGraph Version** (`langgraph-example.js`):

#### 🧠 **Step 1: Create Nodes**
```javascript
// Thinking Node - AI processes the question
async function thinkingNode(state) {
  const userMessage = state.messages[state.messages.length - 1];
  const aiResponse = await ai.invoke([userMessage]);
  return { messages: [aiResponse] };
}

// Answer Node - Formats the final response
async function answerNode(state) {
  const aiMessage = state.messages[state.messages.length - 1];
  const finalMessage = new AIMessage(`✨ Final Answer: ${aiMessage.content}`);
  return { messages: [finalMessage] };
}
```

#### 🔗 **Step 2: Connect with Edges**
```javascript
const simpleGraph = new StateGraph(State)
  .addNode("thinking", thinkingNode)
  .addNode("answer", answerNode)
  .addEdge(START, "thinking")     // START → Thinking
  .addEdge("thinking", "answer")  // Thinking → Answer
  .addEdge("answer", END);        // Answer → END
```

#### 📊 **Step 3: State Management**
```javascript
const State = Annotation.Root({
  messages: Annotation({
    reducer: (old, newMessages) => old.concat(newMessages),
    default: () => [],
  })
});
```

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### 🎯 **LangGraph Output Example:**
```bash
🎯 Welcome to SIMPLE LangGraph!

❓ Your Question: "What is 2 + 2?"
===================================================

🚀 Running the graph...

🧠 THINKING NODE: AI is thinking...
❓ User asked: "What is 2 + 2?"
💭 AI responded: "2 + 2 = 4"

🎯 ANSWER NODE: Preparing final answer...
🎉 ✨ Final Answer: 2 + 2 = 4

====================================================
✅ Graph finished!
```

### 🔍 **What You See:**
